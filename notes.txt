xFor I2C:
Analog 4 is SDA - Analog 5 is SCL.

We can connect multiple devices to these two pins, but we need to ground all of them.

Remember that running the serial port fucks with the Mozzi audio output.

The datasheet:  http://www.cypress.com/?docID=41804
Remember that I am NOT using GP0[4] or GP1[4] - I only have 8 outs per chip

I may need to drop register 2 of chip 2:  it is not reliable.

XRES:  Connect directly, one needed for each chip!

Final layouts, if we use six chips
A-C#-F:  57, 61, 65
E-Ab-C:  64, 68, 60
B-Eb-G:  59, 63, 67
F#-Bb-D: 66, 58, 62

A-C#-F:  69, 73, 77
E-Ab-C:  76, 80, 72
B-Eb-G:  71, 75, 79
F#-Bb-D: 78, 70, 74



Note that if you lose a button, it is probably because the resistor has bent and is touching something else.
Give it a wiggle, and re-upload, and cross fingers.
Note that for the pd version, I need to boot the arduino, PD, and then the python connector.

PUTTING THINGS INSIDE THE TUBE.
I need to mount both boards, the arduino, and the battery.  How can I do this?
- Glue?  foam to the bottom of the boards + dunio?



ORDER OF OPERATIONS
-I need to mount the speaker on the far end. How can I do this?
- Glue?  
- I need to mount the amp near the speaker.  I might be able to just have it hang, as it is tiny.

- PROBLEM:  it turns out that doing too many things in UpdateControl creates insane noise.
- Not even.  It turns out that making wire. calls in UpdateControl creates insane noise. Shit.
- OK:  the more calls to wire that you have, the worse it is.
- I need to make a serial-sending version and make or find a nice PD or Chuck synth for it.

- Then I need to wrestle with getting this on-board audio to pop:  I could make it single touch with chords?
- Touching two buttons, regarless of board, causes the distortion.
- 

- Glue the boards in place, somehow
- More tape to hold the pipe back together, pray.

Then, I need to print another cover, and attach it.

Then I need a drink.  Or six.  Or seven.
