xFor I2C:
Analog 4 is SDA - Analog 5 is SCL.

We can connect multiple devices to these two pins, but we need to ground all of them.

Remember that running the serial port fucks with the audio output!!!

The datasheet:  http://www.cypress.com/?docID=41804
Remember that I am NOT using GP0[4] or GP1[4] - I only have 8 outs per chip
XRES:  Connect directly, one needed for each chip!

Final layouts, if we use six chips.  The other branch has working arrays for this.
A-C#-F:  57, 61, 65
E-Ab-C:  64, 68, 60
B-Eb-G:  59, 63, 67
F#-Bb-D: 66, 58, 62

A-C#-F:  69, 73, 77
E-Ab-C:  76, 80, 72
B-Eb-G:  71, 75, 79
F#-Bb-D: 78, 70, 74

PUTTING THINGS INSIDE THE TUBE.
I need to mount both boards, the arduino, and the battery.  How can I do this?
- Glue?  foam to the bottom of the boards + dunio?
- I need a battery case too.

I need a switch for the battery.
An LED would be nice.  
The ardunino USB should come out of one end, as should the switch and LED
The speaker should come out the other end.


ORDER OF OPERATIONS
- TEST, board by board:  VICTORY (solved by increasing the noise threshold on the chips)
-I need to mount the speaker on the far end. How can I do this?
- Glue?  
- I need to mount the amp near the speaker.  I might be able to just have it hang, as it is tiny.

- PROBLEM:  it turns out that doing too many things in UpdateControl creates insane noise.
- Not even.  It turns out that making wire. calls in UpdateControl creates insane noise.  Shit
- I am currently trying to fix this using a new wire library.  ho ho ho. 
- First:  be able to set up the chips.


- Then I need to wrestle with getting this on-board audio to pop:  I could make it single touch with chords?
- Touching two buttons, regarless of board, causes the distortion.
- 

- Glue the boards in place, somehow
- More tape to hold the pipe back together, pray.

Then, I need to print another cover, and attach it.

Then I need a drink.  Or six.  Or seven.
