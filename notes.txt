For I2C:
Analog 4 is SDA - Analog 5 is SCL.

We can connect multiple devices to these two pins, but we need to ground all of them.


Remember that running the serial port fucks with the audio output!!!

The datasheet:  http://www.cypress.com/?docID=41804
Remember that I am NOT using GP0[4] or GP1[4] - I only have 8 outs per chip

Protoboard layout:

Column 1:  Power
Column 3:  Ground
Column 5:  SCL
Column 7:  SDA

XRES:  Connect directly, but only for one chip
