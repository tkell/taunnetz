For I2C:
Analog 4 is SDA - Analog 5 is SCL.

We can connect multiple devices to these two pins, but we need to ground all of them.

Remember that running the serial port fucks with the audio output!!!

The datasheet:  http://www.cypress.com/?docID=41804
Remember that I am NOT using GP0[4] or GP1[4] - I only have 8 outs per chip

I may need to drop register 2 of chip 2:  it is not reliable.

XRES:  Connect directly, one needed for each chip!

Final layouts, if we use six chips
A-C#-F:  57, 61, 65
E-Ab-C:  64, 68, 60
B-Eb-G:  59, 63, 67
F#-Bb-D: 66, 58, 62

A-C#-F:  69, 73, 77
E-Ab-C:  76, 80, 72
B-Eb-G:  71, 75, 79
F#-Bb-D: 78, 70, 74

pitchArrays, lowest to highest:  
A-C#-F, A-C#-F, E-Ab    {57, 61, 65, 57, 61, 65, 64, 68};
C, E-Ab-C, B-Eb-G, B    {60, 64, 68, 60, 59, 63, 67, 59};
Eb-G, F#-Bb-D, F#-Bb-D  {63, 67, 66, 58, 62, 66, 58, 62};

A-C#-F, A-C#-F, E-Ab    {69, 73, 77, 69, 73, 77, 76, 80};
C, E-Ab-C, B-Eb-G, B    {72, 76, 80, 72, 71, 75, 79, 71};
Eb-G, F#-Bb-D, F#-Bb-D  {75, 79, 78, 70, 74, 78, 70, 74};




PUTTING THINGS INSIDE THE TUBE.

I need to mount both boards, the arduino, and the battery.  How can I do this?
- First I should glue the boards together
- Glue?  foam to the bottom of the boards + dunio?
- I need a battery case too.

I need a switch for the battery.
An LED would be nice.  
The ardunino USB should come out of one end, as should the switch and LED
The speaker should come out the other end.


ORDER OF OPERATIONS

- Finalize the Xres header and wires:  solder the wires on  
- Finalize the power/ground and i2c headers:  solder the wires on
- This will keep the arduino close to its final location, at the foot of the tube.
- Glue protoboards together.
-

I need to thread in each final-wire, and solder it to the correct resistor.  (I may need to trim the resistors.)
Then I need to test that.  

I need to mount the boards inside. 
I need to GENTLY pull each write through, clip it, and tape it down.

I need to get my amps.
I need to attach the amps to the speaker.
I need to solder long wires to the amp, and attach them to a header.
I need to test this header and amp
I need to mount the speaker on the far end. How can I do this?
- Glue?  
- I need to mount the amp near the speaker.  I might be able to just have it hang, as it is tiny.
I need to connect the header to the arduino


Then, I need to print another cover, and attach it.

Then I need a drink.
